Windows 10 Theme Collection
===========================
Installation Walkthrough
------------------------
1. Before attempting to apply custom themes, create a **restore point**.


![restore](https://github.com/OliverKurz/windows-10-themes-custom-selection/raw/master/images/restore.png)

2. There's an installer included in "files\patcher" for the **theme patcher** Theme Signature Bypass that I recommend using:

![patcher](https://github.com/OliverKurz/windows-10-themes-custom-selection/raw/master/images/patcher.png)

Or trying [UltraUxThemePatcher](https://www.syssel.net/hoefs/software_uxtheme.php?lang=en) instead.

3. These custom themes rely heavily on the correct settings of [OldNewExplorer](http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/170375-oldnewexplorer-118/).
Take a few minutes to download and copy the newest version of ONE to a location on your filesystem and open ONE as administrator to carefully look at the check boxes you have in your ONE settings and compare them with mine:

![one](https://github.com/OliverKurz/windows-10-themes-custom-selection/raw/master/images/ONE.png)

Once you made sure you're using the same ONE settings that I am, click **install**.

If you're new to themeing on newer versions of Windows (8+) and have a problem with your theme not looking right, 90% of the time it is your configuration of ONE.

4. Install [StartIsBack++](http://startisback.com/#download-tab) to skin the start menu and taskbar. Here are a few options that I recommend using:

![sib](https://github.com/OliverKurz/windows-10-themes-custom-selection/raw/master/images/sib.png)


I have included start orbs in "files\orbs". Select the theme's start menu and an orb in the StartIsBack++ configuration and click apply. If it's not an option to choose the theme's start menu, later on you can check once your custom theme is applied. The "files\orbs_downsized" directory contains start orbs modified to work properly with the small taskbar buttons setting enabled.

5. [Winaero Tweaker](https://winaero.com/download.php?view.1796) is the go to application for tweaking the rest of your system.

6. [Aero Glass for Win8.1+](http://www.glass8.eu/) is an optional advanced customization tool worth checking out. I have included my aero glass atlas themes located in "files\atlas-theme-collection", which you could optionally move to your Aero Glass folder if you choose to install it. Aero Glass can be safely installed in the existing "AeroGlass" directory if you chose to install Theme Signature Bypass to patch you system. In "files\transparency_app" I included an app I found to perform mouse and keyboard gestures, and as a bonus it allows easy setting of transparency levels for any app.



7. Install the fonts included in the "files\fonts" folder. This is an important step people sometimes forget. Type `ctrl+a` then rc + click "install" with "no" and "do this for all current items" clicked.

8. Merge the reg files in "files\rc_context_menu" so that it's possible to switch themes from the desktop rc menu, and remove the immersive context menus that are present by default in the explorer rc menu.

9. Merge the system metrics for the theme you intend to run included in the "files\system_metrics" folder so your window frames will be custom sized and custom fonts will display in their intended locations. You can safely overwrite the settings for a custom system metrics file by merging another.
+ **logout or reboot.**

10. Cut/paste the contents of "themes" into your themes folder (in my experience this has always been "C:\Windows\Resources\Themes"). I had to remove the sounds and have only one wallpaper per theme to limit the download size. Apply your theme via "Control Panel -> Personalization" from the desktop rc menu "Personalize (classic) -> Theme Settings".

**I take no responsibility for anyone that bricks their system, use custom themes at your own risk!!**
